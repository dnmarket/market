# A Market

An open market that does not require client-side javascript.  Designed to be scalable and resilient against attack.

## But it's not really distributed!  What about OpenBazaar??

Yep, this is a centralized market.  But it is designed to operate in a horizontally-scalable way.  It is entirely possible (probable?) that OpenBazaar and that ilk will make centralized markets a thing of the past.  But let's face facts -- it will be several years before truly decentralized markets will gain any traction among the general public.
